title: Starting a new project! Hyped API!
image: /img/api_first.jpg
---

Hey everyone, every now and then I start a new project to learn or practice some tool. This time I will try something different. Iâ€™m planning to create an API from the ground up using all the tools that I want to learn, going through the process of getting the API from the first commit to publish it as a real product.

I will create bi-weekly posts with the following:

- Updates of the project
- What I am working on.
- Why I am using these tool.
- How these tools works

If you know about a bleeding edge tool that we could work with, send me a message and I will be glad to look and give it a try.

Ok, so how is this going to work? I have created a plan for the first 10 sprints. A sprint will not have an exact time frame since I can only commit 5h/week to this project and some of these tools will probably require different effort to really understand how they works. But even if a sprint lasts a month, I will still write bi-weekly reports so you can follow the project.
