# Hyped-API

Hey everyone, every now and then I start a new project to learn or practice some tool. This time I'll try something different. I'm planning to create an API from the ground using all the tools that I want to learn, going through the process of getting the API from the first commit to publish it as a real product.

I'll create bi-weekly posts with:
- Updates of the project
- What I'm working on.
- Why I'm using these tool.
- How these tools works

If you know about a  bleeding edge tool that we could work with, send me a message and I'll be glad to take a look and give a try.

Ok, so how it gonna work?
I've created a planning for the first 10 sprints. A sprint won't have an exact time frame since I'm planning to work on that only 5h/week and some of these tools will probably require different effort to really understand how it works. But even that a sprint could take a month, I'll make bi-weekly reports so you can follow the project.
